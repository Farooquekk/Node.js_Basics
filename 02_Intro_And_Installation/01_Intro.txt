1). Node.js is a js runtime environment that allows you to run js outside the browser. It is build on chrome's V8 engine and enables you to write backend/server-side code.

2). Key Features of Node.js:-
    
    * Asynchronous and Non-blocking :- Handles multiple request efficiently.
    * Single Threaded :- Uses an event loop for concurrency.
    * Cross Plateform :- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    * Fast and Scalable :- Built on the V8 engine, optimized for performance.
    * Uses JS  :- Same language for both Frontend and Backend.

--> V8 is Google's open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others.   

--> Chrome V8 performs what is called just-in-time compilation. Instead of compiling JavaScript in advance, it compiles the code at the same time that it is executed.

--> A runtime environment is the software environment in which code is executed.
