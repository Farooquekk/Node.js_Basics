// Using the REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) in Node.js
// REPL is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs (i.e. single expressions), evaluates them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise.

// To start the REPL, open your terminal and type node. You should see the > prompt, which means you're in the REPL environment.

// You can type any JavaScript code in the REPL, and it will be executed immediately. For example, you can type console.log('Hello, World!') or 2+3 and press Enter to see the output.

// press Ctrl + C twice to exit the REPL.
